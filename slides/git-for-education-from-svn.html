# Git For Education
Learning Git in your CS program can be hard, and sometimes you come from SVN!

This should help.

* Getting started
  * what is DVCS
  * how are changes stored
    * Data structure of git
    * Hashing
  * 90% of work done without Internet connection
    * Only sharing when you decide to (push/pull/fetch, etc)
* Init
  * .git/ at top level
  * watches everything below it.
    * don't need to ensure "checkins" are done at different folders
  * git config
* 3 stage thinking
  * Shopping Cart
    * Bi-directional
    * `git status` helps you put things in, and take things out
  * Add
  * Commit
* Log/diff ( Optional )
  * Do a pull on the git project live
  * `git log -S <string-in-patch>`
  * `git log -g <regex-for-message>`
  * `git log --author=peff`
* BRANCHES. ALL THE TIME.
* Fast merges (heavy "read more after" material) for experiments.
* Push/Pull
  * could try to avoid showing "out of date from origin/master by n-commits"
