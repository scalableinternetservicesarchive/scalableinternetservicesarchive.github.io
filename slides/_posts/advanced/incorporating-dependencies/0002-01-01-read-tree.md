{% capture notes %}
* Notice the working tree content differs between the dependency and the main project.
* Establishing the association of a subdirectory and the branch is necessary when creating the association.
* Whenever the branch needs updating, switch to it, retrieve the changes and commit them against the main project branch(es).
